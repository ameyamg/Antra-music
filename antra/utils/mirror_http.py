r"""
Shared TLS-resilient HTTP session and plain-language network errors for the
mirror adapters (v1.1.8 BUG-2).

BUG-2 was reported against Amazon only, and the fix landed there first. This
lifts the same treatment out of `amazon.py` so the other mirrors get it without
four copies of the same logic drifting apart.

Three things are shared:

1. **A TLS fallback session.** Some users cannot complete a handshake to the
   mirrors from `requests` (OpenSSL) while the same host works fine elsewhere —
   typically a middlebox that dislikes Python's TLS fingerprint, or an
   intercepting proxy. curl_cffi is already bundled and presents a real Chrome
   fingerprint, so it often succeeds where OpenSSL does not. Scoped to
   NON-streaming GETs so streaming download paths keep their `requests`
   response objects and `with ... as r:` usage unchanged.

2. **Proxy visibility.** `requests.Session.trust_env` defaults to True, so a
   system/WinINET or environment proxy is inherited *silently* — and an
   intercepting proxy on 443 is one of the likeliest causes of
   `WRONG_VERSION_NUMBER`. Inheritance is deliberately NOT disabled (plenty of
   users need it); the active proxy is simply logged when TLS fails, so the next
   bug report contains the answer.

3. **Plain-language errors.** A raw
   `SSLError(SSLError(1, '[SSL: WRONG_VERSION_NUMBER] wrong version number'))`
   tells a user nothing and reads like a server outage, which is the wrong
   conclusion: WRONG_VERSION_NUMBER means the bytes coming back are not TLS at
   all, so something on the network path answered instead of the mirror.
