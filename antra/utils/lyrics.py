"""
Lyrics fetching — synced-first waterfall across multiple providers (v1.1.8 FEAT-9).

The previous implementation had two sources and one controlling bug:

    lrc = self._fetch_lrclib(track)
    if lrc:
        plain, synced = lrc
        if plain or synced:        # <-- `plain` alone satisfied this
            return plain, synced   # <-- the synced source was NEVER tried

LRCLIB has very large *plain-only* coverage, so any track where it had text but
no timings returned immediately and never consulted a provider that might have
had synced lyrics. That single `or` is the mechanical explanation for
"most lyrics are not synced" — it was a priority bug, not a coverage problem.

This module inverts the rule: **never settle for unsynced lyrics while an
unqueried provider might have synced ones.** The best result so far is kept and
only returned once the whole chain is exhausted.

Provider order (best synced coverage first), measured 2026-07-30:

  1. Apple Music (via our own mirror) — by far the best, and the only one with
     meaningful non-Western coverage. On a Hindi sample Apple returned synced
     lyrics for Kesariya (44 lines), Chaiyya Chaiyya (94) and Tum Hi Ho (36),
     while LRCLIB found *nothing at all* for any of them.
  2. LRCLIB — excellent where it has data, free, no key. Queried with several
     phrasings (with album, without album, search, simplified title), an idea
     taken from SpotiFLAC's `FetchLyricsAllSources`.
  3. Paxsenix — Spotify-derived LRC, last resort.

Every candidate is verified before it is accepted (see `_candidate_is_plausible`).
Attaching a *different song's* lyrics is the lyrics-shaped version of BUG-1, and
the old `results[0]` search fallback could do exactly that.

        **LRCLIB leads, Apple follows.** The first cut had Apple first, on an

        catalogues. Measuring from the VPS disproved that: LRCLIB answered every

        costs an ISRC resolution against a pool that rotates ~15 accounts with
        waits between them — 5.9s on a good run, a 10s timeout on a bad one.
        Apple-first therefore added minutes per album to reach an answer LRCLIB

        Ordering by cost does NOT weaken the synced-first rule, which is the
