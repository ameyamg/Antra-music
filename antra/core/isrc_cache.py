Persistent Spotify track ID → ISRC cache (v1.1.8 FEAT-6, ported from SpotiFLAC).

SpotiFLAC keeps a bbolt-backed `trackID → ISRC` cache so a track resolved once is
never looked up again. Antra had no persistent ISRC cache at all: every run
re-resolved the same ISRCs from scratch, which costs API calls and is a genuine
rate-limit exposure — v1.1.3 BUG-12 was exactly this, ISRC enrichment tripping
Spotify's 429 and bailing with 0/12 tracks enriched.

Deliberately adapted rather than copied:

  * **SQLite, not bbolt.** `provider_stats.py` already establishes the pattern in
    this codebase (SQLite in the platformdirs user-data dir, every operation
    degrading to a no-op on failure). Adding a second embedded-KV dependency for
    one small table would not be worth it.
  * **Resolution source is stored.** ISRC accuracy became a correctness concern in
    v1.1.8 BUG-1, where adapters were fabricating confidence. Recording *how* an
    ISRC was resolved means a future session can invalidate one source's entries
    without discarding the whole cache.
  * **Entries expire.** SpotiFLAC's cache is permanent. A wrong ISRC — from a
    mis-tagged release or a source that later corrects itself — would be cached
    forever and would keep producing the same wrong match on every run, which is
    precisely the failure mode BUG-1 was about. A TTL bounds that damage.

Negative results are cached separately and briefly: "this track has no ISRC" is
worth remembering for one session so a playlist does not re-query it per run, but
not for weeks, because catalogues do get corrected.
